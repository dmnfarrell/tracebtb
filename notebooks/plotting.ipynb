    "* **all_moves_from_not_sl** shows all cases where one of the Monaghan sample animlas (N = 112) moved from a herd during its lift, excluding its final move to slaughter. Moves from herd with no record of a breakdown are shown with NULLs or 0s in all columns which measure the existence of breakdowns in those herds\n",
    "* **summary_move_from** shows a summary of the \"all_moves_from_not_sl\"  dataset, summarised for each of the sample animals. Cases where the animal has not moved from any herd until its slaughter data are indicted with NULLS in most of the columns.\n",
    "* **period moves** shows all time period where one of the Monaghan sample animals (N = 112) was in a herd which experienced a breakdown at some time, as well as all periods where the animal was in a herd with another animal (the \"matched animal\") and whether the matched animal had itself been in any herd which experienced a breakdown at any time.\n",
